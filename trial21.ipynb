      "Keywords: Secure communication in the digital age is necessary; securing audio data becomes very critical since this is normally transmitted across susceptible networks. Traditional approaches to encryption, like Advanced Encryption Standard and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman, are pretty solid but mostly too computationally intensive for real-time audio applications. This paper presents a new audio encryption scheme using chaotic systems, characterized by high sensitivity to initial conditions, pseudo-randomness, and determinism. These properties make chaotic systems ideal for generating keys for cryptographic purposes. Indeed, complex keys that would be nearly impossible to reverse-engineer\n"

Also, the implementations consist of independent graphical user interfaces that can be utilized on various devices such as microcomputers, computers, etc. A pseudorandom generator based on two-dimensional Henon-Sine hyperchaotic map for microcontrollers is an illustration [23], and also a secure communication system implemented on a microcontroller [24] using a five-term 3D chaotic map [25].\n",

A unique two-phase speech encryption method, utilizes an innovative chaotic map, 2D-LMSM, Fast Fourier Transform, and the Discrete Wavelet Transform [26]. This strategy has shown impressive results in both encrypting techniques. A new 3D chaotic system with a capsule-shaped equilibrium curve is another significant contribution [27]. Two new integrated chaotic maps for speech encryption algorithms and the sine-logistic maps are used to create a Sine-Logistic Integrated Map(SLIM) and the sine and cube maps are used to create Sine Cubic Integrated Map (SCIM) [28].\n",

Samples of mono and stereo audio data were encrypted. Discrete-time chaotic systems in both single and double dimensions were employed in this application. A non-linear function was also used in a separate technique to increase security during encryption. Keyspace, key sensitivity, chaotic effect, and histogram analysis were used to obtain findings in the chaos-based application implemented using the developed method. These analysis results were used to test the application’s chaotic system safety.\n",

This study presents a control approach between various chaotic dimensional systems, analyzing the synchronization stability utilizing the controller and Lyapunov [31] stability theory as a basis. Lastly, a new concept for an audio synchronization encryption technique is presented. The simulation’s findings indicate that there is little to no link between the original audio document’s waveform and the encrypted version. It is further confirmed by comparing the spectrum that this design has an amazing encryption effect.\n",

Based on the transformation of audio data samples into visual data, audio encryption and decryption techniques are researched. The audio signals are encrypted and decrypted using a random mask that is created from a chaotic mask. It is demonstrated that the fractional order hyperchaotic system’s error path is far superior to the classical one. Furthermore, by examining several measures in addition to numerical simulations, such as MSE, PSNR, SSIM, NPCR, and SNR [33], the high-level security of the suggested work is trusted.\n",
