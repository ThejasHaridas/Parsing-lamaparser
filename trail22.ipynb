The main objectives are to explore the use of chaotic systems in securing audio data and to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct encryption schemes based on these systems. The methodologies involve the use of chaotic maps to encrypt audio data, including the 2D quadratic memristor map and the 3D hyperchaotic map. The significant findings include the ability of these systems to provide strong security for audio data while maintaining acceptable audio quality. The potential implications are far-reaching, offering a secure and efficient solution for audio communications in various fields, including telecommunications, military communications, and confidential conferencing systems.\n"

      "The provided process explains how to encrypt an audio file using signal processing and cryptography techniques. This encryption method is outlined below in a logical sequence which is represented in the flowchart 3. First, the original audio file (org_aud) is used to start the encryption process. To separate the raw audio data for additional processing, the audio file’s header — which usually includes metadata like file format and properties — is removed. By eliminating additional potentially identifying information, this step ensures the encryption is restricted to the audio material. After that, the SHA3-512 algorithm [43] is used to hash the isolated audio data, the data of audio is given in the Table 1. A fixed-size, 512-bit hash value that precisely represents the audio file’s contents generated by this cryptographic hash function. The hashing process secures the uniqueness and integrity of the audio by assuring that even slight alterations in the audio will result in a significantly distinctive hash value [44]. Then, the hash value is split into eight equal parts, which will be utilized for producing the encryption keys and parameters in the following steps.\n"

      "📝 Document Summary Generation:\n",
      "The provided document discusses the efficacy of using 2D and 3D hyperchaotic systems for audio encryption. It highlights the benefits of chaotic systems in generating secure keys and encrypting audio data. The encryption process involves digitizing the audio signal and then encrypting each sample using chaotic sequences from multiple systems. The paper evaluates two distinct encryption schemes based on 2D memristive hyperchaotic maps and 3D hyperchaotic systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in securing audio data while maintaining acceptable audio quality.\n",
